                <p style="color: aliceblue;">The Indian cricket team romped to their 8th victory in as many matches as
                    it
                    hammered South Africa in a Cricket World Cup 2023 match at Eden Gardens on Sunday. The Indian
                    team's
                    stupendous show in the tournament has earned them plenty of plaudits from the cricketing
                    universe.
                    Against the Proteas, India secured a whopping 243-run win to strengthen their spot at the top of
                    the
                    points table. But, there remain some like former Pakistan cricketer Hasan Raza who feel Rohit
                    Sharma's men are 'manipulating DRS' to get things their way.</p>

                    <p>The Indian cricket team has been enjoying a brilliant run of form with their seventh victory on
                        the trot in Cricket World Cup 2023. The Rohit Sharma-led side is the only unbeaten team in the
                        competition right now and with a massive win over Sri Lanka on Thursday, they booked their spot
                        in the semifinals. When the team was leaving for Kolkata from Mumbai ahead of their
                        much-anticipated match against South Africa, a fan asked him if the World Cup trophy is already
                        guaranteed for India. "World Cup apna hai na (is the World Cup ours?),‚Äù he asked.</p>

                    <p>World Cup 2023 Points Table: India's winning run over South Africa is going strong and how! The
                        Rohit Sharma-led Indian cricket team notched its eighth-straight win with a commanding result
                        against South Africa. The match at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday was a top of the table
                        clash with both the teams having already sealed a semi-final slot. A proper competition was
                        expected but Indian cricket team thrashed its rivals by a huge 243-run win.</p>

                    <p>Virat Kohli's 49th century in the Cricket World Cup 2023 match against South Africa might have
                        brought joy to millions but there remain a few who don't agree with the approach he had en route
                        the triple-digit score. Kohli scored 121-ball 101 as India put 326 runs on the board. On a
                        tricky surface, South Africa could only score 83 runs in reply. But, former Pakistan all-rounder
                        Mohammad Hafeez feels what he saw from Virat was a 'selfish' display of batting, something that
                        India captain Rohit Sharma could've also done but he chose to put the team forward.

                        Working as a pundit for a Pakistani TV channel, Hafeez accused Kohli of putting himself ahead of
                        the team to reach the illustrious milestone.</p>

                    <p>The Indian cricket team is unstoppable at the Cricket World Cup. On Sunday, the Rohit Sharma-led
                        side defeated South Africa to register an eighth straight win the ODI Cricket World Cup 2023.
                        Batting first, India notched a huge total of 326/5 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Then Indian
                        bowlers continued their fiery show to dismiss the Proteas for just 83 as India romped home to a
                        243-win. With the win, the Indian cricket team is assured of a top finish in the round-robin
                        stage at the Cricket World Cup 2023.</p>

                    <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed the Indian cricket team's win over South Africa in
                        the World Cup and said they have also given a "great birthday gift" to Virat Kohli.
                        On his 35th birthday, Kohli equalled his idol Sachin Tendulkar's record of most ODI centuries
                        with his 49th hundred, laying the foundation for India's 243-run thrashing of South Africa in
                        the World Cup on Sunday.
                        In a post on X, Modi said, "Our cricket team is triumphant yet again! Congratulations to the
                        team for a splendid performance against South Africa. Great teamwork." "They have also given a
                        great birthday gift to Virat Kohli, who played a lovely innings today," he said.</p>

                        the way they are playing in the marquee event.
                        With team India registering yet another thumping win, it seems not only players of one country
                        could stop Rohit Sharma's men in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. After chasing the targets
                        comfortably in the early part of the marquee event, India were not only defending the targets
                        but also not allowing the opposition to cross the 100-run mark. Check ICC Cricket World Cup
