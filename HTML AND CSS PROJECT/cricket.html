            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p> India men's international cricket team, known as the "Men in Blue," is a force to be reckoned with

                18th century by British colonizers. The first cricket club in India was established in 1792. However, it
                took nearly two decades for the team to earn Test cricket status and play their first international
                match against England at Lord's in 1932.</p>
